## Infobox ##

Each lowest-level box on the poster will describe a genus.  It could feature the following information:
  - Scientific Name;
  - Common Name (see below);
  - Entirely Extinct / contains some extinct species;
  - number of species / is monotypic;
  - picture;
  - Range (using the 8 Ecozones? see wikipedia);
  - IUCN status (copyright?).
  - Date of Discovery?

## Ecozones ##

For most mammals could use
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_ecozone
(proably not for marine mammals).

Possible abbreviations:
  PA - Palearctic
  NA - Nearctic
  AT - Afrotropic
  NT - Neotropic
  AA - Australasia
  IM - Indomalaya
  OC - Oceania
  AQ - Antarctica

## Common Name ##

Common Names for Genera.

[MSW3] has common names for species, but not for genera (I
checked all the genera in the downloaded CSV).  For monotypic
genera we can use the common names of the species.  The type species
is given for each genera, maybe that is useful.

This is annoying.  *Lepus* clearly have the common name Hares,
but I can't find a database that has that.  Perhaps the whole
thing is fruitless.  *Lepus* includes species with common name
jackrabbit, and excludes species with common name hare
(*Caprolagus hispidus* and *Pronolagus spp*). (OTOH Lepus has
genbank common name 'hares' in the NCBI dataset).

The wikispecies.py program extracts common names from
wikispecies, which may be an additional useful source (for
example, it has common names for *Martes* *Nasua* *Procyon*).

## Extinction ##

*Hydrodamalis* is extinct, but the NCBI database doesn't record it
as such.  Perhaps in general MSW3 is a more reliable source, but
then again it also lists *Hydrodamalis* as not extinct (but notes
in a comment that IUCN list the species as extinct *sigh*).
