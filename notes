Common Names for Genera.

[MSW3] has common names for species, but not for genera (I
checked all the genera in the downloaded CSV).  For monotypic
genera we can use the common names of the species.  The type species
is given for each genera, maybe that is useful.

This is annoying.  *Lepus* clearly have the common name Hares,
but I can't find a database that has that.  Perhaps the whole
thing is fruitless.  *Lepus* includes species with common name
jackrabbit, and excludes species with common name hare
(*Caprolagus hispidus* and *Pronolagus spp*). (OTOH Lepus has
genbank common name 'hares' in the NCBI dataset).
